## 🔥 Wallet Powers Explained

### **Generate a Seed Phrase**
Magically create a secure seed phrase:

```dart
import 'package:bip39/bip39.dart' as bip39;

String generateSeedPhrase() {
  return bip39.generateMnemonic();
}
```

### **Restore a Wallet**
Bring your existing wallet back to life:

```dart
import 'package:solana/solana.dart';

Future<Ed25519HDKeyPair> restoreWallet(String seedPhrase) async {
  final seed = bip39.mnemonicToSeed(seedPhrase);
  return Ed25519HDKeyPair.fromSeed(seed);
}
```

### **Secure Your Secrets**
Lock your seed phrase like Fort Knox:

```dart
import 'package:flutter_secure_storage/flutter_secure_storage.dart';

final storage = FlutterSecureStorage();

Future<void> saveSeedPhrase(String seedPhrase) async {
  await storage.write(key: 'seedPhrase', value: seedPhrase);
}

Future<String?> retrieveSeedPhrase() async {
  return await storage.read(key: 'seedPhrase');
}
```

### **Talk to Solana**
Check your account balance faster than you can say "blockchain":

```dart
import 'package:solana/solana.dart';

Future<void> getAccountBalance(String publicKey) async {
  final client = SolanaClient(
    rpcUrl: Uri.parse('https://your-quicknode-url.com'),
    websocketUrl: Uri.parse('wss://your-quicknode-url.com'),
  );

  final balance = await client.rpcClient.getBalance(publicKey);
  print('Account Balance: $balance');
}
```

### **Smooth Navigation**
Glide through the app with `go_router`:

```dart
import 'package:go_router/go_router.dart';

final GoRouter router = GoRouter(
  routes: [
.............
    GoRoute(
      path: '/',
      builder: (context, state) => HomePage(),
    ),
    ..........
  ],
);
```
